# bufrPlot
#This program plots the dry bulb and dew point temperature from radiosonde bufr files. 
#Before running, make sure to point INPUTPATH to the bufr file you want to input and OUTPUTPATH to the directory where you want to save the image.

#This script was tested on 1 specific file, so the number of advances required may be different if you use a different file.
#This likely be automated in a future commit.
